https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pig,Pig: Reproduction,"{'reproduction', 'pig', 'pigs'}",[7],"Female pigs reach sexual maturity at 3–12 months of age and come into estrus every 18–24 days if they are not successfully bred The variation in ovulation rate can be attributed to intrinsic factors such as age and genotype, as well as extrinsic factors like nutrition, environment, and the supplementation of exogenous hormones[46] The gestation period averages 112–120 days[47] IMAGE7  Estrus lasts two to three days, and the female's displayed receptiveness to mate is known as standing heat Standing heat is a reflexive response that is stimulated when the female is in contact with the saliva of a sexually mature boar Androstenol is one of the pheromones produced in the submaxillary salivary glands of boars that will trigger the female's response[48] The female cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads, or folds, that will hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation[49] Females have bicornuate uteruses and two conceptuses must be present in both uterine horns for pregnancy to be established[50] Maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs occurs on days 11 to 12 of pregnancy and is marked by progesterone production from a functioning corpus luteum (CL)[51] To avoid luteolysis by PGF2α, rescuing of the CL must occur via embryonic signaling of estradiol 17β and PGE2[52] This signaling acts on both the endometrium and luteal tissue to prevent the regression of the CL by activation of genes that are responsible for CL maintenance[53] During mid to late pregnancy, the CL relies primarily on luteinizing hormone (LH) for maintenance until parturition[52] Animal nutrition is important prior to reproduction and during gestation to ensure optimum reproductive performance is achieved[54] Archeological evidence indicates that medieval European pigs farrowed, or bore a litter of piglets, once per year[55] By the nineteenth century, European piglets routinely double-farrowed, or bore two litters of piglets per year It is unclear when this shift occurred[56] "
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pig,Pig: Behavior,"{'pig', 'behavior', 'pigs'}",[8],"IMAGE8  In many ways, their behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of other artiodactyls and of carnivores[57] Pigs seek out the company of other pigs and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds They typically live in groups of about 8–10 adult sows, some young individuals, and some single males[58] Because of their relative lack of sweat glands, pigs often control their body temperature using behavioural thermoregulation Wallowing, which often consists of coating the body with mud, is a behaviour frequently exhibited by pigs[59] They do not submerge completely under the mud, but vary the depth and duration of wallowing depending on environmental conditions[59] Typically, adult pigs start wallowing once the ambient temperature is around 17–21 °C (63–70 °F) They cover themselves from head to toe in mud[59] Pigs may use mud as a sunscreen, or as a method of keeping parasites away[59] Most bristled pigs will ""blow their coat"", meaning that they shed most of the longer, coarser stiff hair once a year, usually in spring or early summer, to prepare for the warmer months ahead[60] If conditions permit, pigs feed continuously for many hours and then sleep for many hours, in contrast to ruminants which tend to feed for a short time and then sleep for a short time Pigs are omnivorous, and are highly versatile in their feeding behaviour As they are foraging animals, they primarily eat leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and flowers[61] Pigs play an important role in regions where pig toilets are employed Pigs are highly intelligent animals,[62] on par with dogs,[63] and according to David DiSalvo's writing in Forbes, they are ""widely considered the smartest domesticated animal in the world Pigs have demonstrated the ability to move a cursor on a video screen with their snouts and understand what is happening onscreen, and have learned to distinguish between the scribbles they had seen before and those they were seeing for the first time""[64][a][68] "

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pig,Pig: Nest-building,"{'nest-building', 'pig', 'pigs'}",[],"A behavioural characteristic of pigs which they share with carnivores is nest-building Sows root in the ground to create depressions and then build nests in which to give birth First, the sow digs a depression about the size of her body She then collects twigs and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound She distributes the softer, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material She then gives birth in a lying position, which, again, is different from other artiodactyls, which usually give birth in a standing position[57] Nest-building behaviour is an important part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour Nest-building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing[71] Nest-building is divided into two phases: one of which is the initial phase of rooting in the ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material[71] The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind that has well-drained soil This nest-building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation The nest will provide protection against weather and predators while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away from the rest of the herd This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing milk from the sow[72] Nest-building can be influenced by internal and external stimuli Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour[72] The onset is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin, while the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature[71] The longer time spent on nest-building will increase pre-partum oxytocin[citation needed] "

with an overrepresentation of genes classified as low tissue specificity, as exemplified by clusters 22, 53, and 66 Functional analysis shows that cluster 66 (2285 genes) is mainly enriched for genes related to transcription, RNA processing, and DNA repair Similarly, cluster 22 contains 204 genes related to DNA-template regulation of transcription, while cluster 53 only includes 19 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, verifying the housekeeping-related functions of the clustersThirteen clusters were annotated as “low abundant - uncharacterized” due to limited gene information, low expression levels, and limited functional data However, among the uncharacterized clusters, olfactory receptors were highly represented with cluster 6 harboring 73 out of 88 genes coding for olfactory receptors

transcriptome correlation between species for the individual tissue types ranges from 060 to 080 Collectively, the body-wide gene expression comparison between pig and human thus suggests that the
